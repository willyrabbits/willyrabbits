## Hi! I'm [Guille Martinez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillemmc) 👋🏽

I'm a Front End Engineer born in Barcelona, but grown up all around the world 🌏.

I love coding in both **React Native** and **React.js**, and currently learning **Flutter**. Besides that, I like sports in general 🏃🏽‍♂️⛷🚴🏽‍♂️🤾🏽‍♂️🛹🏊🏽‍♂️ and being outdoors 🏝🏔. Last but not least, I really love the surfing lifestyle and atmosphere ☀️🏄🏽‍♂️🌴, I hope to have the beach as my backyard someday. You may have already noticed, but traveling is my passion! ✈️
